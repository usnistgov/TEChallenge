      <h2 class="section-title">NIST Transactive Energy Analytical Measurement System (TEAMS)</h2>
      <h3 >Research at NIST to support transactive energy implementation through federated co-simulation.</h3>
      <p >NIST is developing the measurement science to support evaluation of transactive energy (TE) methods for electric grid management. This includes the co-simulation framework, simulation tools, TE model, transactive scenarios, and TE experiment evaluation metrics which together form the NIST Transactive Energy Analytical Measurement System (TEAMS). TEAMS will support research to understand the potential role of transactive energy for management of the distribution grid, considering different grid architectures, actors, and transactive methods. </p>
      <p>In 2018, NIST published a paper describing a transactive energy abstract component model [ref paper]. This model was developed as part of the NIST TE Modeling and Simulation Challenge for the Smart Grid (TE Challenge) [link TE Challenge Drupal] and describes the core components and interfaces that compose a TE co-simulation. This model also forms the foundation for interoperable TE co-simulations by providing initial definition of common interfaces between components that might be produced by different research teams.</p>
      <p>NIST is assembling software and/or hardware implementations that realize the interfaces of this model within its Universal CPS Environment for Federation (UCEF). UCEF serves as the foundation for NIST’s Transactive Energy Analytical Measurement System (TEAMS). TEAMS is being built on NIST’s advanced Cyber-Physical Systems/Internet of Things Testbed technology to fill today’s gap in the ability to measure performance across the many different TE models and implementations being considered by utilities across the nation. In addition, the collection of UCEF federates includes modules for running a TE experiment and collecting metrics based on results. </p>
      <p>This website provides links to currently available work products as NIST builds up a library of components. TEAMS may be used by TE researchers as a framework for co-simulation that will enable integration of disparate simulation tools via common interfaces into a TE experiment. This in turn will allow NIST and other researchers to collectively understand different TE approaches for providing a variety of grid services. </p>
