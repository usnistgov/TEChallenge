# TE Challenge Tool Chest

## Phase II Challenge Scenario 

TE Challenge teams have worked together to agree on: 
>> a common <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/TEChallenge/Library/TEChallengeScenario20170714.docx">Challenge Scenario</a>, and 
<br/>
>> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/TEChallenge/Library/TECMetrics20170714.docx">Common Metrics</a> for reporting results<br/>

Teams will simulate the agreed-on scenario and report using the agreed upon metrics. As part of the process, teams will be encouraged to use the identified common grid topology to aid in comparison of results, but it is not required that every team use the same grid. Teams may use a reduced version of the grid, modified grid, or even a different grid as is necessary to implement the use case on the team simulation platform and as needed to fit the team goals for TE methodology or other research goals of a team. 

Through a series of meetings (May-July 2017), teams are in process of taking the following actions. The result of this collaboration will be to better understand the common TE co-simulation model, and to help us to produce TE simulation results that can be more easily compared and which together will increase our understanding of the useful application of TE methods.

  * Review the Phase I common platform model (platform-agnostic model for interoperable TE co-simulation) and consider how different teams might take a step toward implementing some part of the model in their research;
  * Review and agree on the Challenge Scenario narrative;
  * Review available grid definitions that we might use or modify for use by teams;
  * Discuss and agree on the set of simulations we will perform using the Challenge Scenario;
  * Develop a set of common metrics to be used to report team simulation results, that allows comparing results of TE co-simulations;
  * Share results of team efforts to implement the Challenge Scenario.

More details about the process, and each of the bullet items above, is included in the

The Phase II Simulation Phase is in progress through January 2018, based on implementing the above referenced Challenge Scenario. 

## Modeling and Simulation Tools

Modeling and simulation tools and platforms for grid simulations were identified at our TE Challenge Preparatory Workshop.  Some of these tools may be useful for transactive grid simulations (and co-simulations). The table of tools in our Tool Chest is based on input from our workshop attendees. The table provides a short description of each tool based on the owners own claims from the tool website. Those who think a tool might be useful can follow the link to get more information. TE Challenge participants may provide links to other tools and additional information to add to this table.

## Data sets

If you know of publicly available data sets, please send us a link so we can add to the Tool Chest.

## Baseline Scenarios

In order to have results that are more comparable between teams, allowing results to be more easily integrated, with common resources, objectives and metrics, a  set of baseline scenarios is being prepared in a collaborative process.

## FAQ

**Q. How do organizations participate--where's the funding?**

A. Many groups are attaching their participation to existing projects, teaming up with other organizations to gain the benefits of collaboration with shared goals. Other teams find funding from one team member or another. 

**Q. What kind of reporting is required?**

A. Our primary goal is to give a platform for teams to form and do exciting work and then share that with others. We do hope that teams will supply information that helps us (TE community) understand:
    What modeling and simulation tools were used for what purposes.
    What tool extensions were made or new co-simulations performed.
    What TE approaches were investigated and what results were found.
    What data resources were used, tools developed, exciting results found, collaborations formed, lessons learned, and other resources that might be used to build up the TE community. 

**Q. What are the IPR-sharing requirements?**

A. All information and results provided as part of the Challenge will be in the public domain. This does not preclude the use of proprietary techniques or tools to achieve the results. Team leaders will be asked to manage team IPR issues, and each team can decide for themselves how to handle contributions to the team. 

**Q. What is the long-term goal for the Challenge?**

A. NIST has been working on Smart Grid standards interoperability for 6+ years. TE is about responsive demand for the next generation grid. We see the development of TE as slow process and this TE Challenge as on step to work toward knowledge of how different TE approaches work, and which may then lead to actual utility implementations.
